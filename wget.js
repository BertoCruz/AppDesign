I didn't get a chance to finish yesterday's work, with my thesis proposal due yeasterday and meetings and work I wasn't able to finish.
however, the assignment heavily entails in being able to read a file that contains both the url link and the destination in which to 
save those files. The wget.js file would first off be able to read this file that contains both of these elements. Second, the function
would need to be able to read two ines at a time, so as to sepearte the url line from the destination source, and be able to save it into an array.
once the destination files and the url files are saved in an array, we would then be able to read each index, one by one, in order to feed
it into our "download" functon, that takes in the url source and destination source. Simple as that :)
