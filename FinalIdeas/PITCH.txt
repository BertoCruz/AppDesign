For the first final idea, which would heavily entail our main focus of interest, Collin and I have thouht about working with a 
database structured international cookbook. I mean, who doesn't like to cook? Our project would be focusing on being able to 
read/write different recipes from around the world. We plan on working with servers, just like in our last honor assignment. 
We also plan on making this project an interactive realm, where guest chefs will appear with tips and help on certain recipes 
found within our cookbook. Guest appearances will include Julia Child, Chef Gordon Ramsay (from top chef), and many more! 
Furthermore, we will also work heavily with the appearance/image whenever a new page gets loaded.


For our second idea, which really doesn't mean much (because we clearly express a great interest in the culinary arts), will 
be to make an app that is able to play music and turn itself off, based on a timer set by the user. This idea is great for people
who like to listen to music/sounds in order to help them fall asleep. This app will also be able to give tips on sleep cycles and 
general advice on why sleep is important. The app will also be able to turn the phone/computer off by itself, because, naturally, 
you'd be asleep once the timer stops.
